# Exercise

1. Create/modify a script which generates a pen holder with maximum dimensions of 100 x 100 x 150mm (xyz). Use either Grasshopper or GH Python

1. Generate 4 versions using the same script, modifying the parameters. You can either make 5 entirely different versions of the same object, or show an object slowly transforming into its final form.

1. Use curves which are then lofted to create a closed polysurface. 

1. Bake the 4 versions into your Rhino file and submit it using the Slack channel #gh_python_submission. Name your file: **'191003_GHPython_Exercise_FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME'** (eg: 191003_GHPython_Joris_Burger). Submission deadline: 23.59 on Friday 04.10.2019.
