### Osnap
Object snaps constrain the marker to an exact location on an object
	
### SmartTrack
Temporary reference lines and points that are drawn in the Rhino viewport
	
### Gumball
Display widget, on a selected object, facilitating move, scale, and rotate transformations
	
### Record History

## Layers
By creating objects on different layers, you can edit and view related portions of a model separately or as a composite.
